### Architecture

Frontend: React.js
- Component-based UI for dynamic features like interactive maps, itineraries, and user feeds.
- React Router for handling navigation between pages (Home, Search, Map, My Log, Profile).
- State management tools like Redux for managing complex application states, such as user data and trip logs.

Backend: Flask
- Easy implementation for RESTful API 
- Flask works well with PostgreSQL (structured data like user profiles)
